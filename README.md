# Group 5 University System 

A console-based university student management system developed in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This system allows students to register, log in, enrol in subjects, view and remove subjects, and update their passwords. Admins can manage student records with options to group, partition, and clear data.

# Features 

### Student Functions
Students can register with a university email and a secure password, then log in to access their personalized course menu. From there, they can enrol in up to four subjects, remove any enrolled subjects if needed, view a list of their current subjects, and update their passwordâ€”provided it meets the required security standards.

### Admin Functions
Administrators have access to tools that allow them to manage the student database efficiently. They can clear all student data, group students by their grades, separate students into pass or fail categories, remove specific students by ID, and display a complete list of all registered students.

### Password Requirements
To ensure account security, passwords must meet several criteria. A valid password must include at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter, and a minimum of three digits. It must also contain at least one special character from the set @ # $ & ! % *, and have at least five alphabetical letters in total. Additionally, the overall password length must be between 8 and 20 characters.

### Email Format
Student email addresses must follow the structure of a valid university domain format. Specifically, the email should be in the form of firstname.lastname@university.com, using only letters, periods, and hyphens before the "@" symbol. This ensures the identity and format are consistent across all student accounts.
